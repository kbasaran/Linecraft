# Linecraft
Frequency response plotting and statistics tool developed using Qt for Python

## Introduction
Linecraft is a convenience tool that can import frequency response curves from several sources such as csv files, spreadsheet applications or dB-lab. It allows plotting of the curves using Matplotlib library in different styles. It also offers several manipulation and statistical analysis possibilities:
- Linear interpolation to octave spaced frequency points
- Calculation of mean and median response from imported curves
- Calculation of interquartile range and detection of outliers based on their z-score
- Sorting of curves based on their weighted correlation to another curve (i.e. best fit or reference selection)
- Display of curves relative to a chosen reference curve
