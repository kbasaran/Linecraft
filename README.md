# Linecraft
Frequency response plotting and statistics tool developed using Qt for Python

## Introduction
Linecraft can import frequency response curves from csv files, spreadsheet applications or dB-lab. It allows plotting of the curves using Matplotlib library. It offers following manipulation and statistical analysis possibilities:
- Linear interpolation to octave spaced frequency points
- Calculation of mean and median responses from imported curves
- Calculation of interquartile range and detection of outliers based on their z-score
- Sorting of curves based on their weighted correlation to a reference curve (i.e. best fit or reference selection)
- Display of curves relative to a reference curve (i.e. set reference curve as y=0)

## Installation
Work in progress..
